  org.apertis.NavigationGuidance1.Progress.xml:
  @short_description: interface exposing information about progress on the current route
  @since: 0.1612.0

  This API is meant to be implemented by the navigation backend to expose
  information about progress on the current route.

  When a new journey is started from the navigation system the StartTime
  and EstimatedEndTime properties should be set accordingly.
  The details about the route followed by this journey can be found using the
  org.apertis.Navigation1.Routes API.

  The backend should claim the org.apertis.NavigationGuidance1.Progress
  well-known name and expose the /org/apertis/NavigationGuidance1/Progress
  object.

  Changes are notified using the standard org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties
  signals.
