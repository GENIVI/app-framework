  org.apertis.Navigation1.Route:
  @short_description: Interface representing a potential route
  @since: 0.1.0

  Each Route object represents a potential navigation route.

  Route objects are immutable once created. Any change should be done by
  adding a new route and removing the old one.
-->

<interface name="org.apertis.Navigation1.Route">
  <!--
  Geometry:
  @since: 0.1.0

  Array of latitude-longitude pairs in order, from the start point to the
  destination (inclusive).
  This array is guaranteed to have at least two entries: the start and the
  destination of the route.
  -->
  <property name="Geometry" type="a(dd)" access="read"/>

  <!--
  TotalDistance:
  @since: 0.1.0

  The total distance covered by the route, in metres.
  -->
  <property name="TotalDistance" type="u" access="read"/>

  <!--
  TotalTime:
  @since: 0.1.0

  An estimation of the total time, in seconds, needed to travel along
  this route from start to destination (not from the current vehicle
  position).
  -->
  <property name="TotalTime" type="u" access="read"/>

  <!--
  Title:
  @since: 0.1.0

  Mapping from language name to a human-readable title of the route in this language.
  Language names are using the POSIX locale format with locale identifiers defined by ISO 15897,
  like 'fr_BE' for example.
  -->
  <property name="Title" type="a{ss}" access="read"/>

  <!--
  GeometryDescriptions:
  @since: 0.1.0

  An array of pairs of index and description. Each key represents an index
  in the Geometry array and points to the
  human-readable descriptions, indexed by language, of this point.
  Language names use the same format as in the Title property.
