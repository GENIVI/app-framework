# App Framework

## Synopsis
Application framework consists of a software framework used by software developers to implement the standard
structure of an application. The GENIVI Reference Architecture works with two different approaches to 
developing applications, namely the Managed and the Native application type.  Most people associate Application 
Framework mostly with the solution for the Managed application category, which includes a well-defined and 
limited set of application APIs and usually a constrained (“sandboxed”) execution environment

## Motivation
The GENIVI Alliance standardizes the non differentiating part of the In Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) middleware 
by delivering requirements, interfaces and code. The App FW deliveries are requirements and interfaces. An open 
API allows systems to plug in more than alternative App frameworks coming from different vendors, limiting 
the porting workload and providing reused tools for unit and integration testing.
