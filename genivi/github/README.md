App Framework

Synopsis
Application framework consists of a software framework used by software developers to implement the standard
structure of an application. The GENIVI Reference Architecture works with two different approaches to 
developing applications, namely the Managedand the Native application type. Most people associate Application 
Framework mostly with the solution for the Managed application category, which includes a well-defined and 
limited set of application APIs and usually a constrained (“sandboxed”) execution environment

Motivation

The GENIVI Alliance standardizes the non differentiating part of the In Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) middleware 
by delivering requirements, interfaces and code. The App FW deliveries are requirements and interfaces. An open 
source API for App FW allows system to easily plug in App coming from different vendors on top of App Fw, by limiting 
the porting workload and providing reused tools for unitary and integration testing.
