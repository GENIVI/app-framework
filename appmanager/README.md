App Manager

Synopsis


Motivation

The GENIVI Alliance standardizes the non differentiating part of the In Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) middleware 
by delivering requirements, interfaces and code. The App FW deliveries are requirements and interfaces. An open 
source API for App FW allows system to easily plug in App coming from different vendors on top of App Fw, by limiting 
the porting workload and providing reused tools for unitary and integration testing.
