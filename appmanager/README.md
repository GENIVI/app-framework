aimed at supporting apps, in a GENIVI setting. The App Manager is responsible for the handling the app 
life-cycle of a Managed Apps.

### Managed Apps are
- Downloadable apps
- Third party developed Apps
- It provides full sandboxing


## Motivation

The GENIVI Alliance standardizes the non differentiating part of the In Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) middleware by delivering requirements, interfaces and code. The App FW deliveries are requirements and interfaces. An open API allows systems to plug in more than alternative App frameworks coming from different vendors, limiting the porting workload and providing reused tools for unit and integration testing.
